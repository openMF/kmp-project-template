> Part of [`feature/`](../feature.md)  
> **Measured:** 49 tracked files — 27× `.kt`, 20× `.xml`, 1× `.md`, 1× `.kts`

**27 Kotlin files** — 4 screen(s), 4 ViewModel(s).

Screens: `AffordabilityCalculatorScreen`, `AmortizationScreen`, `LoanCalcWizardScreen`, `LoanComparisonScreen`

ViewModels: `AffordabilityCalculatorViewModel`, `AmortizationViewModel`, `LoanCalcWizardViewModel`, `LoanComparisonViewModel`

**Consumes:** `core/store/banking`, `core/store/calc`, `core/store/config`

**Store5 archetype(s) exercised:** `CACHE_ONLY`, `LOAD_ONCE`, `OFFLINE_LOCAL_ONLY` — from `core/store/STORE_ARCHETYPES.yaml`, which product-health fails the build against when an archetype loses its last showcase.

## Significance

Four calculators — affordability, amortization, comparison and a multi-step wizard — and the widest
range of screen patterns in one module.

The wizard is the **`DraftSubmitHandler`** showcase: it persists its form on every step so a part-filled
wizard survives process death, and resumes with a Continue / Discard prompt. The other three are pure
local state with no Store at all, which is the other thing this module demonstrates — that the
framework does not force a Store where there is no data to fetch.

## API reference

_Generated from `feature/calculators` at tree `d085aa71c6f1` by `scripts/docs/api-docs-gen.sh`._
_Do not hand-edit inside this block — re-run the generator. Authored prose belongs outside it._

This module is **fork-owned and writable** — the opposite of `core-base/**`. It is published
here as a WORKED EXAMPLE: this is the shape a generator should produce for a new feature,
with its real Screen / ViewModel / Route wiring. Call into `core/**` and `core-base/**`
rather than re-declaring what they already own.

### `feature/calculators/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/calculators/affordability/AffordabilityCalculatorScreen.kt`

```kotlin
fun AffordabilityCalculatorScreen(
```
Stateful entry point — resolves the ViewModel and hands its state to `AffordabilityCalculatorScreenContent`.

### `feature/calculators/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/calculators/affordability/AffordabilityCalculatorViewModel.kt`

```kotlin
class AffordabilityCalculatorViewModel :
```
Pure-compute VM for B5 Affordability Calculator. Demonstrates the "no Store, no network" archetype: input state → derived `AffordabilityResult` flow.

<details><summary>Used in the template — <code>feature/calculators/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/calculators/affordability/AffordabilityCalculatorScreen.kt:71</code></summary>

```kotlin
    onBackClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    viewModel: AffordabilityCalculatorViewModel = koinViewModel(),
) {
    val state by viewModel.stateFlow.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    val result by viewModel.affordability.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
```

</details>

```kotlin
data class AffordabilityState(
```
The calculator's inputs. Pure local state — nothing is persisted or fetched, so the state IS the screen.

```kotlin
@Composable
internal fun AffordabilityCalculatorScreenContent(

    onIncomeChange: (Double) -> Unit,
    onObligationsChange: (Double) -> Unit,
```

</details>

```kotlin
sealed class AffordabilityAction
```
One action per input, so a change is a single well-typed event rather than a whole-state replacement.
