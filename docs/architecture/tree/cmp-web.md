## Significance

The Kotlin/JS and Kotlin/Wasm browser targets. Both compile the same shared Compose app; they are
separate source sets only because the two Kotlin backends do not share an interop layer.

**Web has one ordering constraint worth knowing.** Secure storage — passcode, auth state — is AES-GCM
encrypted under a **non-extractable** WebCrypto key, and decrypting it is asynchronous. Koin builds
the secure `Settings` from that store, so `SecureSettingsFactory.warmUp()` must COMPLETE before
`initKoin()`. Starting Koin first makes the very first read race the key load and the factory throws —
which is why `main()` is a coroutine rather than a straight call.
