## Significance

The platform-wise secret toolkit. `setup-secrets.sh` is the interactive intake, `secrets-status.sh`
reports what is present per platform, and `sync-secrets-to-github.sh` pushes to repository secrets.

Every path resolves through `secrets/LAYOUT.yaml` rather than being hardcoded, which is what lets a
secret move without touching a consumer. `_write_file` chmods AFTER writing so a secret is never briefly
world-readable, and nothing here ever prints a value — metadata always suffices to prove materialisation.
