# for EVERY part of this repository, is there a page, is it current, does it say something, and does
# what it says still resolve?

#   A1  every project area has a page, or a published reason for having none
#   A2  every documentation UNIT (deploy platform, script group, feature, module) has a page
#   A3  every generated page's authored half says something (≥20 words, not the placeholder)
#   A4  every generated page is current with source           → refresh.sh --check
#   A5  every path named in authored prose exists             → doc-refs.sh --strict
#   A6  every internal markdown link resolves, repo-wide
#   A7  every public symbol is documented                     → doc-scan.sh
#   A8  the generators are DETERMINISTIC across platforms     → static, see below

# A4 asks whether the committed pages match what the generator produces HERE. It cannot ask whether

# through that blind spot, each of which made A4 pass on macOS and fail on the Linux runner:
#
#   1. an unsorted `find` feeding call_site()'s `head -1`, so the rendered example was whichever
#      file the FILESYSTEM listed first (APFS and ext4 disagree)
#   2. `sort` under a UTF-8 locale folds case, so `di/SecurityModule.kt` sorted before
#      `FailedAttemptTracker.kt` where C order puts it after — and module-hash.sh hashes that list,
#      so the sha= anchor moved with it
#   3. mawk (Ubuntu's /usr/bin/awk, hence the runner's) accepts `{2,}` but is NOT greedy with it: it
#      matched `Kpt`/`The`/`Foo` where BSD awk and gawk match `KptTheme`. The index filled with
#      three-letter fragments and EVERY call-site block silently vanished on Linux
#   4. `.` in a length-bounded regex counts characters under UTF-8 and bytes under C, so a
#      241-character / 243-byte KDoc summary kept its second sentence on one platform only
#
# Each is cheap to detect statically and expensive to find empirically — it took a Linux container to
# see any of them. So this check is static on purpose: it holds the invariant without CI having to
# run the generator twice on two operating systems.
