package kpt.core.firebase.config.analytics

/**
 * CROSS-CUTTING analytics event keys — TEMPLATE-OWNED, full-copied by every sync.
 *
 * Everything here is true of ANY app built on this template: a session begins, a screen is shown, a
 * request succeeds or fails, data syncs, a permission is granted. None of it names a feature.
 *
 * ## Where feature events go — NOT here
 * A feature's events live in its own package, `kpt/core/firebase/<feature>/` (e.g. `loans/`),
 * outside `config/`. In a fork that file is fork-owned; a sync never rewrites it, so its own
 * events survive every template upgrade. Adding a feature constant to THIS file has two costs:
 * the next sync overwrites it, and every unrelated fork inherits a key for a feature it does not ship.
 *
 * This file previously carried CLIENT / GROUP / CENTER / SURVEY / SAVINGS / MEETING / ATTENDANCE /
 * COLLECTION / REPAYMENT keys — a specific lender's domain, in a brand-neutral template. Those moved
 * out: a fork that ships those features declares them in its own feature packages.
