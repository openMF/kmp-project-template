## Significance

Secret material. `secrets/live/` is **gitignored and fork-owned**; `secrets/sample/` is the committed
shape a contributor copies from, so the layout is discoverable without any real value being present.

**Two intake paths, both deliberate.** An OSS fork copies `sample/` and fills it in. A
framework-managed project runs `/secrets pull`, which materialises from a SOPS+age vault to the
canonical paths declared in `secrets/LAYOUT.yaml`. Every consumer — Fastlane, the workflows, the dev
build — resolves through that layout rather than hardcoding a path, so moving a secret is one edit.

**A value must never reach a transcript or a log.** Metadata always suffices to prove materialisation:
`test -f`, `wc -c`, `shasum`. If a check appears to need the value itself, the check is wrong.
