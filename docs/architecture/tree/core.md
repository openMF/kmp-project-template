## Significance

The fork's own data and design layer, and the seam every feature reads through. It is the answer to
"where does my project's code go" — `core/model` for domain types, `core/network` for API clients,
`core/database` for Room entities and DAOs, `core/store` for the Store5 wiring, `core/data` for the
repositories a feature consumes, `core/designsystem` for brand tokens.

**The dependency order is the architecture.** `network` and `database` and `datastore` sit below
`store`; `store` is consumed by `data`; `data` is what a feature injects. A repository that reads a
DAO directly while its writes go through the store is the split-read defect product-health's Store5
checks exist to catch — the layers are not stylistic.

**What a fork touches:** all of it. `core/store/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/core/store/config/AppScreenStateDefaults.kt` brands every empty and
error state in one place, `AppErrorMapper` maps domain errors to copy, and a `@StoreProvider`
annotation is the whole registration — the KSP processors in `tools/` generate the registry, ids,
cache keys, Koin binding and logout purge, so there is no registry to edit and no DI module to
remember.
