## Significance

GitHub Pages from the Kotlin/JS distribution. The simplest target: one Gradle task, one branch push,
no signing and no review queue.

Its significance is as the **fast feedback loop** — a web deploy proves the shared Compose code renders
and the app boots without waiting on a store. When a UI regression appears here, it is in the shared
code rather than in a platform shell.
