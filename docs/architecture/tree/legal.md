## Significance

The privacy policy and terms, **generated** from `app-profile` by `legal/generate.sh` rather than
written per fork. A store rejects a listing whose policy names no legal entity, and a hand-written
policy drifts from the app the moment a data-collection answer changes.

`render()` substitutes only the variables in `LEGAL_VARS`. A bare `envsubst` would also expand
anything else in the legal text that happens to look like a shell variable — which in a document full
of `$` and braces is a real risk, not a theoretical one.
