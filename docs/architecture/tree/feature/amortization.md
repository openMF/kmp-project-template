# `feature/amortization/`

> Part of [`feature/`](../feature.md)  
> **Measured:** 31 tracked files — 20× `.xml`, 9× `.kt`, 1× `.md`, 1× `.kts`

**9 Kotlin files** — 1 screen(s), 1 ViewModel(s).

Screens: `AmortizationScheduleScreen`

ViewModels: `AmortizationScheduleViewModel`

**Consumes:** `core/store/banking`

**Store5 archetype(s) exercised:** `CACHE_ONLY`, `LOAD_ONCE`, `OFFLINE_LOCAL_ONLY` — from `core/store/STORE_ARCHETYPES.yaml`, which product-health fails the build against when an archetype loses its last showcase.

## Significance

The month-by-month payment schedule for a tracked loan — **`OFFLINE_LOCAL_ONLY`**, a projection of the
loan repository with no network involved.

Its cost scales with tenure: a 30-year loan is 360 rows. That is why the schedule is Store-backed
despite being computed — a revisit is free, and `SCHEDULE_ROWS` is a crash key precisely because an
out-of-memory failure here scales with that number.

## API reference

_Generated from `feature/amortization` at tree `0a91fe6b9ad3` by `scripts/docs/api-docs-gen.sh`._
_Do not hand-edit inside this block — re-run the generator. Authored prose belongs outside it._

This module is **fork-owned and writable** — the opposite of `core-base/**`. It is published
here as a WORKED EXAMPLE: this is the shape a generator should produce for a new feature,
with its real Screen / ViewModel / Route wiring. Call into `core/**` and `core-base/**`
rather than re-declaring what they already own.

### `feature/amortization/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/amortization/di/AmortizationModule.kt`

```kotlin
val AmortizationModule = module
```
Koin module for the amortization-schedule feature. Wired into the app graph by `cmp-navigation/.../KoinModules.kt`. The `LoanRepository` binding is provided by `core/data/.../RepositoryModule.kt`.

```kotlin
data class AmortizationScheduleRoute(val loanId: String)
```
Route for one loan's amortization schedule.
