package kpt.core.firebase.config.crashlytics

/**
 * CROSS-CUTTING crash context — TEMPLATE-OWNED, full-copied by every sync.
 *
 * Mirrors its `config/analytics/` sibling: this file knows about NO feature. A feature's crash context
 * lives with its analytics in `kpt/core/firebase/<feature>/`, outside `config/` — fork-owned in a
 * fork; the shipped `loans/` is the template's showcase of that layout.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 * A stack trace says where a crash happened; it rarely says what the user was doing. These helpers
 * attach the breadcrumbs that make a report actionable — which screen, which sync, which request —
 * through the kmptoolkit [CrashReporter] contract (`recordException` / `log` / `setCustomKey`).
 *
 * ## The rule these helpers exist to enforce
 * A crash report leaves the device and is readable by anyone with console access, so **no key set
 * here carries a value the user typed, an amount, or an identifier that resolves to a person**.
 * Screen names, request paths and durations describe the app; account numbers describe the user.
 * Feature packages inherit the same rule — see `loans/` for how it is applied.
