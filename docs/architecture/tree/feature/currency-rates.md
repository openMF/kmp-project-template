# `feature/currency-rates/`

> Part of [`feature/`](../feature.md)  
> **Measured:** 37 tracked files — 20× `.xml`, 15× `.kt`, 1× `.md`, 1× `.kts`

**15 Kotlin files** — 2 screen(s), 2 ViewModel(s).

Screens: `CurrencyRatesScreen`, `RateHistoryScreen`

ViewModels: `CurrencyRatesViewModel`, `RateHistoryViewModel`

**Consumes:** `core/store/config`, `core/store/currency`

**Store5 archetype(s) exercised:** `NETWORK_WITH_CACHE`, `PERIODIC` — from `core/store/STORE_ARCHETYPES.yaml`, which product-health fails the build against when an archetype loses its last showcase.

## Significance

Live FX rates plus a historical chart — the **`NETWORK_WITH_CACHE`** showcase, and the one place a
windowed series is keyed correctly.

The chart's window length is *part of the store key*, so widening it is a different key and a full
re-fetch rather than a page append. Getting that wrong produces a chart that silently shows a short
window's data under a long window's axis.

## API reference

_Generated from `feature/currency-rates` at tree `f53d99f6a682` by `scripts/docs/api-docs-gen.sh`._
_Do not hand-edit inside this block — re-run the generator. Authored prose belongs outside it._

This module is **fork-owned and writable** — the opposite of `core-base/**`. It is published
here as a WORKED EXAMPLE: this is the shape a generator should produce for a new feature,
with its real Screen / ViewModel / Route wiring. Call into `core/**` and `core-base/**`
rather than re-declaring what they already own.

### `feature/currency-rates/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/currencyrates/di/CurrencyRatesModule.kt`

### `feature/currency-rates/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/currencyrates/ui/CurrencyRatesViewModel.kt`

```kotlin
class CurrencyRatesViewModel(
```
**Archetype showcase: CACHE_ONLY + NETWORK_ONLY** In addition to the regular exchange-rates stream (NETWORK_WITH_CACHE default), this ViewModel demonstrates policy routing based on network status: - Online → `FetchPolicy.NETWORK_ONLY` (always-fresh spot rate, no stale cache) - Offline → `FetchPolicy.CACHE_ONLY` (read cached value, never call API) The `spotConversionRate` property is the canonical reference implementation for this archetype pattern. See `AppStoreRegistry.SpotRate` for the store registration.

What the list renders: the base currency, its date, and the rates.

### `feature/currency-rates/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/currencyrates/ui/RateHistoryScreen.kt`

```kotlin
fun RateHistoryScreen(
```
Historical FX chart for a pair, over a selectable window.

### `feature/currency-rates/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/currencyrates/ui/RateHistoryViewModel.kt`

```kotlin
class RateHistoryViewModel(
```
Drives the historical chart. The pair and window form the store key, so changing either re-keys the stream rather than filtering in memory.

```kotlin

The chart's selection — which pair and how far back.
