## Significance

**The fork-owned source of truth for identity.** Every brand-touching value lives here — app id,
display name, version, org details, endpoints, icons, store listing, the store-compliance forms — and
`./gradlew syncForkConfig` projects it onto every generated surface: `gradle/fork.properties`, the
version catalog, `Config.xcconfig`, per-module BuildKonfig, per-flavor BuildConfig, the platform icon
trees and the deployment metadata.

**Edit here, never downstream.** `gradle/fork.properties` is a generated bridge, not the SoT, and
`libs.versions.toml#appId` is written from it — `scripts/product-health/checks/appid-consistency.sh`
fails CI when the two drift. A hand-edit to the bridge survives exactly until the next sync.

**The compliance YAMLs are not paperwork.** The age-rating, content-rights, export-compliance and
data-safety declarations are what a store checks before review. An incorrect answer is a policy
violation rather than a listing error, and a missing
`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` stops every upload to ask — which blocks an automated release. They
are authored here so the answers are reviewable in a diff and reproducible on re-submission.
