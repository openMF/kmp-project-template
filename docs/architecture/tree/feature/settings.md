## Significance

The largest feature, and the one that touches the most cross-cutting state: theme, language, dynamic
colour, screen capture, app lock, the conflict inbox and the sync-and-drafts view.

Two of those are worth calling out. The **conflict inbox** is where a MUTABLE store's divergences
surface for a human to resolve — without it, a server-wins resolution silently discards a user's edit.
The **sync-and-drafts** screen makes the offline write queue visible, which is the difference between
"the app lost my change" and "the app is holding my change until it can send it".

`UserEditableSettings` is deliberately narrower than `UserData`, so a settings screen cannot write a
session or lock field it has no business touching.

## API reference

_Generated from `feature/settings` at tree `f30840a0e38c` by `scripts/docs/api-docs-gen.sh`._
_Do not hand-edit inside this block — re-run the generator. Authored prose belongs outside it._

This module is **fork-owned and writable** — the opposite of `core-base/**`. It is published
here as a WORKED EXAMPLE: this is the shape a generator should produce for a new feature,
with its real Screen / ViewModel / Route wiring. Call into `core/**` and `core-base/**`
rather than re-declaring what they already own.

### `feature/settings/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/settings/ConflictInboxViewModel.kt`

```kotlin
class ConflictInboxViewModel(
```
ViewModel for the Settings **Sync conflicts** screen — a live window over the `ConflictInbox` pending feed. Each row is a write the app made that the server diverged on (server-wins was applied, the user's version preserved).

</details>

```kotlin

### `feature/settings/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/settings/Platform.kt`

/** Whether a system-derived palette is available. True on API 31+, where Material You exposes wallpaper colours. */
```

</details>

```kotlin
expect fun supportsDynamicTheming(): Boolean
