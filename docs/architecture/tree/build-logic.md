## Significance

A **separate Gradle build** that supplies every convention plugin the modules apply. Its separateness
is the point: it is compiled before the main build configures, so it can decide what "a KMP library
module" or "an Android application" means in one place rather than in 46 build files.

**`SyncForkConfigPlugin` is the largest piece** and the one a fork depends on most — it is the task
that projects `app-profile/` onto every generated surface. Caching is disabled on it deliberately: it
reads a gitignored `fork.properties` and writes outside the build directory, so a cached result would
be wrong on any machine whose fork config differs.

**`FeatureAggregateConventionPlugin` is why adding a feature needs no registry edit.** It scans each
feature module's `di` and `navigation` packages and generates the Koin, destination and tab
aggregates. The generated objects are the ONLY place those lists exist, so a feature cannot be half
registered.

**Being a separate build has a cost worth knowing:** `detekt` never scanned it, so 41 declarations
here were undocumented while the main build reported full coverage. The doc scanner covers it
explicitly for that reason.
