## Significance

The gates that run before code leaves a machine. `pre-commit.sh` and `pre-push.sh` carry the branch
guard plus Spotless, Detekt and Dependency Guard; `ci-equivalent-check.sh` reproduces CI locally so a
red build is discovered before the push rather than 45 minutes after it.

`verify-dynamic-flavor-propagation.sh` is a canary, not a check: it INJECTS a synthetic flavor, asserts
it auto-derives everywhere, and restores the file on a trap. An interrupted run must not leave a
synthetic flavor behind, which is why the restore is registered rather than called at the end.
