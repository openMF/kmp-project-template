stops two descriptions of one thing from drifting apart._

## Significance

Framework-shared code, **read-only to a fork**. This is the half of the toolkit that upgrades cleanly
across template versions, and it holds the machinery a screen should never re-implement:
`core-base/store` decides every state transition (loading / offline / captive-portal / empty / error /
content, plus freshness), `core-base/ui` owns the scaffolds and the paging footer, `core-base/crypto`
and `core-base/security` hold the platform crypto seams.

**The rule that keeps it upgradable:** do not modify it. Fork pressure goes to `core/`, which is why
`core/store` exists as a thin branding seam over `core-base/store`. A change made here in one project
is drift — every other project keeps the defect and the next sync fights the edit. When a real bug is
found, the fix flows upstream as a PR rather than landing locally.

**Read-only to generators, but still taught.** `/implement`'s codegen never writes here, yet every
generator is trained on these APIs — being read-only is precisely why its documentation has to be
right: a generator that misreads `asScreenStream` produces a screen that compiles and mishandles
offline.
