## Significance

The app shell: the root nav graph, the bottom bar, and the `AppViewModel` that owns theme, locale and
screen-capture policy for the whole process. It sits above every feature because those decisions are
process-wide — a theme change has to reach the root `MaterialTheme`, a locale change has to reach the
root `LayoutDirection`, and no single screen owns either.

**`RootNavViewModel` makes one decision in one place:** splash → onboarding → auth → lock → app. Two
screens re-deriving that order is how an app ends up showing onboarding to a signed-in user.

**The registries are fork seams.** `BackboneRegistry`, `FeatureRegistry` and `TabRegistry` are where a
fork contributes its own body, modules, destinations and tabs. The feature halves are DERIVED by
`build-logic`'s generators; the `Project*Module` seams stay listed by hand because they are core-layer
seams, not features, and nothing under `feature/` declares them.
