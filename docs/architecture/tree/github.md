## Significance

CI and release orchestration. The local workflows are thin wrappers: each maps its dispatch inputs
onto a reusable workflow in `openMF/mifos-x-actionhub` and passes `secrets: inherit`, so the
orchestration lives in one place across every fork.

**Promotion is a rung, not a separate workflow.** Each platform takes a `<platform>_rung` — the top
rung to reach — and every lower rung fires first: `internal → beta → production`. Picking
`production` runs the whole ladder in one dispatch.

**`quality-gate.yml` is deliberately local** rather than the reusable v2: that one bundles SBOM
generation unconditionally, which breaks on Gradle 9 with KMP. Keeping it local is the reason Spotless,
Detekt, Dependency Guard and Kover can run at all.

**The exact action pins live in the workflow files**, never in prose — `grep 'openMF/mifos-x-actionhub'
.github/workflows/*.yml` is authoritative, and a documented version number is out of date the first
time someone bumps one.
