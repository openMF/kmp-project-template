 * Consumer apps should include this module and add their own store bindings
 * in their `core/data` DI module using `StoreFactory` to create store instances.
 *
 * Also provides the framework write-SoT: the [MutationGateway] (the single write door every repo
 * routes mutations through) and its Room-backed [ConflictInbox]. Requires a `NetworkMonitor` (from
 * `cmp-network-monitor`) and the framework `ConflictDao` (from `DatabaseModule`) on the graph.
