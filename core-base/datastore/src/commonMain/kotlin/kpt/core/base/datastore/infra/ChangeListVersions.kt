/**
 * Per-feature last-synced version map. Persisted across runs via
 * [SyncStatePersister] so a `Synchronizer` (in `core/data`) can resume from
 * where the prior sync left off — used by `changeListSync` (Int version
 * → delta `since=N` cursor) and `snapshotSync` (Long epoch-seconds → freshness
 * timestamp).
 *
 * Long-typed values so snapshotSync can store `Clock.System.now().epochSeconds`
 * without overflow.
 *
 * Lives in `core/datastore` (not `core/data`) so [SyncStatePersister] can
 * reference it without creating a `core/datastore → core/data` cycle.
 * `core/data`'s `Synchronizer.kt` imports it via the existing
 * `core/data → core/datastore` dep.
 *
 * @property versions per-collection change-list version, keyed by collection
 *   name. A missing key means never synced, which is why the default is an
 *   empty map rather than zeroes.
