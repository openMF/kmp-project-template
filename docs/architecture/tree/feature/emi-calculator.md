## Significance

The single-purpose EMI calculator, and the **`MEMORY_ONLY`** showcase.

Store-backed even though nothing persists: the calculation is deterministic in its inputs, so the params
double as the cache key and dragging a tenure slider back over a value already tried is served from
memory. It also means the result reaches the screen as a `ScreenState` like every other read surface,
so the calculator renders through the same wrapper as the rest of the app rather than a bespoke
nullable `StateFlow`.

## API reference

_Generated from `feature/emi-calculator` at tree `132862df578c` by `scripts/docs/api-docs-gen.sh`._
_Do not hand-edit inside this block — re-run the generator. Authored prose belongs outside it._

This module is **fork-owned and writable** — the opposite of `core-base/**`. It is published
here as a WORKED EXAMPLE: this is the shape a generator should produce for a new feature,
with its real Screen / ViewModel / Route wiring. Call into `core/**` and `core-base/**`
rather than re-declaring what they already own.

### `feature/emi-calculator/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/emicalculator/di/EmiCalculatorModule.kt`

```kotlin
val EmiCalculatorModule = module
```
Koin bindings for the EMI calculator. Listed in `FeatureRegistry`'s generated bindings, so a fork that removes this feature drops the module with it.

### `feature/emi-calculator/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/emicalculator/navigation/EmiCalculatorNavigation.kt`

```kotlin
data object EmiCalculatorRoute
```
Route for the EMI calculator.

```kotlin
fun NavController.navigateToEmiCalculator(navOptions: NavOptions? = null)
```
Navigates to the EMI calculator.

```kotlin
fun NavGraphBuilder.emiCalculatorDestination(navController: NavController)
```
Registers the EMI-calculator destination.

### `feature/emi-calculator/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/emicalculator/ui/EmiCalculatorScreen.kt`

```kotlin
fun EmiCalculatorScreen(
```
Stateful entry point — resolves the ViewModel and hands its state to `EmiCalculatorScreenContent`.

```kotlin
        // `onBackClick` lambda: the aggregate invokes one uniform shape, and a bespoke signature
        // is exactly what kept this entry hand-wired in FeatureRegistry.
        EmiCalculatorScreen(onBackClick = { navController.popBackStackSafely() })
    }
}
```

### `feature/emi-calculator/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/emicalculator/ui/EmiCalculatorViewModel.kt`

```kotlin
class EmiCalculatorViewModel(
```
EMI calculator — the `calculator_pure` combo on the DYNAMIC-KEY read shape. The form inputs ARE the Store key, so each distinct parameter set is its own cache entry and `flatMapLatest` re-streams on every change.

```kotlin
data class EmiState(

The calculator's inputs.

    onRateChange: (Double) -> Unit,
```

</details>

```kotlin
sealed class EmiAction

One action per input.

### `feature/emi-calculator/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/emicalculator/ui/TestTags.kt`

```kotlin
object TestTags
```
Append-only test-tag registry for the emi-calculator feature. Consumed by Compose UI tests in `feature/emi-calculator/src/commonTest/`. APPEND-ONLY contract (RULE-KMP-COMPOSE-UITEST-001 CU-5).
