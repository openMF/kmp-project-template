## Significance

The Gradle wrapper and `libs.versions.toml`, the single version catalog every module resolves through.

**`appId` in the catalog is generated,** written by `syncForkConfig` from
`app-profile/app.yaml#identity.app_id`. Editing the catalog line directly puts the build and the store
listing into disagreement, and `appid-consistency.sh` fails CI when they drift.

**Module namespaces are deliberately NOT here.** Every module's Android `namespace` derives from the
framework-owned constant `BASE_MODULE_NAMESPACE` (`kpt`) in `build-logic`. It matches the hardcoded
Kotlin package root, has no per-fork meaning, and is kept out of the catalog so it can never cause a
merge conflict during a template sync.
