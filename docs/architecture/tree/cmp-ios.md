## Significance

The Xcode project and the Swift entry point. The shared Compose app arrives as an **XCFramework via
SwiftPM** — `Package.swift` declares the binary target and an Xcode Run-Script phase embeds and signs
it. There is no CocoaPods toolchain, so a contributor needs Xcode and nothing else.

**`Config.xcconfig` is generated** from `app-profile` by `syncForkConfig`; the bundle id and display
name are not authored in Xcode. Editing them in the project file puts the build and the store listing
into disagreement.

**`project.pbxproj` merges, it does not overwrite.** A template sync runs
`scripts/white-label/merge-pbxproj.rb`, which 3-way merges object by object: an upstream addition is
taken, and a genuine overlap is reported as a conflict rather than guessed. A blind copy would discard
every file a fork added to the project.
