 * The one [UrlLauncher], for every target.
 *
 * `cmp-open-url` carries the per-target `actual`s, so there is no source-set split here.
 *
 * These are plain imports, and safely so: [UrlLauncher]'s methods are `launch*` while the delegates
 * are `open*`/`canOpen`, so no member can shadow an import here. That naming is load-bearing — a
 * same-named delegation is self-recursion, not delegation; see the rationale on [UrlLauncher].
