# `feature/loans/`

> Part of [`feature/`](../feature.md)  
> **Measured:** 48 tracked files — 26× `.kt`, 20× `.xml`, 1× `.md`, 1× `.kts`

**26 Kotlin files** — 3 screen(s), 3 ViewModel(s).

Screens: `AddOrEditLoanScreen`, `LoanDetailScreen`, `PersonalLoansListScreen`

ViewModels: `EditLoanViewModel`, `LoanDetailViewModel`, `PersonalLoansListViewModel`

**Consumes:** `core/store/banking`, `core/store/config`

**Store5 archetype(s) exercised:** `CACHE_ONLY`, `LOAD_ONCE`, `OFFLINE_LOCAL_ONLY` — from `core/store/STORE_ARCHETYPES.yaml`, which product-health fails the build against when an archetype loses its last showcase.

## Significance

Personal loan tracking — and the template's reference for a **paging list plus a draft-backed edit
form**. `PersonalLoansListScreen` is `PagingScreenContent`; `AddOrEditLoanScreen` is
`DraftSubmitHandler`, so a part-filled loan survives process death.

It is a *tracker*, not a ledger: `principalRemaining`, `monthsRemaining` and `totalPaid` are
user-maintained, not derived from a payment history. That is a deliberate scope line — a "log a payment"
feature would recompute them, and until it exists the fields must not pretend to be computed.

## API reference

_Generated from `feature/loans` at tree `7c71c2e8ba2f` by `scripts/docs/api-docs-gen.sh`._
_Do not hand-edit inside this block — re-run the generator. Authored prose belongs outside it._

This module is **fork-owned and writable** — the opposite of `core-base/**`. It is published
here as a WORKED EXAMPLE: this is the shape a generator should produce for a new feature,
with its real Screen / ViewModel / Route wiring. Call into `core/**` and `core-base/**`
rather than re-declaring what they already own.

### `feature/loans/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/loans/LoanReminderUseCase.kt`

```kotlin
public class LoanReminderUseCase(
```
Cross-module proof-of-concept demonstrating consumer use of `WorkScheduler`.

### `feature/loans/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/loans/di/LoansModule.kt`

```kotlin
val LoansModule = module
```
Koin module for the personal-loans feature. Wired into the app graph by `cmp-navigation/.../KoinModules.kt` (`featureModule.includes(LoansModule)`).

### `feature/loans/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/loans/navigation/LoansNavigation.kt`

data object LoansGraphRoute
```
Route for the loans nested graph.

```kotlin
data object PersonalLoansListRoute
```
Route for the loan list — the graph's start destination.

data class LoanDetailRoute(val loanId: String)
```
Route for one loan's detail.

```kotlin
data class AddOrEditLoanRoute(val loanId: String? = null)
```
Route for the add/edit form. One route for both, since the form is identical and the id decides which.

```kotlin
fun NavController.navigateToLoans(navOptions: NavOptions? = null)
```
Navigates to the loans graph.

```kotlin
fun NavGraphBuilder.loansGraph(navController: NavController)
```
Registers the loans nested graph.

### `feature/loans/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/loans/ui/AddOrEditLoanScreen.kt`

```kotlin
fun AddOrEditLoanScreen(

Combined add/edit screen. `loanId == null` → add a brand-new loan. `loanId != null` → edit.

<details><summary>Used in the template — <code>feature/loans/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/loans/navigation/LoansNavigation.kt:92</code></summary>

```kotlin
        composableWithPushTransitions<AddOrEditLoanRoute> { entry ->
            val route = entry.toRoute<AddOrEditLoanRoute>()
            AddOrEditLoanScreen(

### `feature/loans/src/commonMain/kotlin/kpt/feature/loans/ui/EditLoanViewModel.kt`

```kotlin
class EditLoanViewModel(

**The canonical multi-formKey `BaseMutationViewModel` (`MutationMode.Draft`) showcase.** Each instance is scoped to a single loan via `uniqueKey = loanId`.

        )
```

</details>

```kotlin
data class LoanFormState(
```
Multi-field form state for the add/edit loan screen. Default values render a sensible "blank form" — kind defaults to PERSONAL, dates default to a stable epoch so the form is deterministic in tests.
