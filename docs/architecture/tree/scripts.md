## Significance

The repo's automation, and the reason a fork can be stood up without a runbook. Four groups matter
most: `white-label/` is the fork lifecycle (`doctor.sh` is the one entry point for setup, verify and
sync), `product-health/` is a 33-check suite that fails the build on architectural drift rather than
on style, `ci/` holds the pre-commit and CI-parity gates, and `docs/` generates this documentation.

**`ruby-exec.sh` is not a convenience wrapper.** rbenv works by PATH interception, so in a shell that
never ran `rbenv init` — a cron job, a GUI terminal, a CI step that reset PATH — `ruby` falls through
to macOS's 2.6 and `bundle exec` dies inside rubygems talking about gem activation. The gems are
fine; the interpreter is wrong. Every Ruby call goes through the resolver, and `product-health`'s
`RT-9` fails the build if a tracked script invokes `bundle` directly.

**`product-health/tests/` is deliberately malformed.** Those 140 Kotlin files are RED fixtures — a
check that cannot be proven to FAIL on broken input has not been tested. They are excluded from
detekt for that reason, not overlooked.
