# scripts/docs/doc-refs.sh — does the AUTHORED prose still name files that exist?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# The generated half of the docs cannot go stale: `refresh.sh --check` re-derives it and diffs. The
# AUTHORED half has no such protection, and it is the half that names things — a script to run, a file
# to edit, a class to look at. When one of those is renamed or deleted, the prose keeps pointing at it
# and a reader goes looking for something that was removed on purpose.
#
# That is not hypothetical here. `scripts/CLAUDE.md` was rewritten in 2026-09 after an audit found it
# describing 8 scripts that no longer existed, 22 that were never mentioned, and every path written flat
# after the tree had moved into subdirectories. A doc that names a missing script costs more than no doc.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS RESOLVED — and why the classes matter
# A flat "does this path exist" check reports ~38% of references dead and is therefore ignored. Five
# resolutions are legitimate and only the sixth is a defect:
#
#   exact        the reference is a tracked path
#   suffix       a tracked path ends with it (`libs.versions.toml` → `gradle/libs.versions.toml`)
#   gitignored   DELIBERATELY absent — `local.properties`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, a keystore.
#                Telling a reader to create one of these is the correct instruction.
#   generated    produced by a build (`BuildKonfig.kt`) — absent in a clean checkout, present after.
#   framework    lives in the framework repo, not this template (`framework-verify-*.sh`).
#   DEAD         nothing explains it. This is the one the gate fails on.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/docs/doc-refs.sh              # summary + the dead list
#   scripts/docs/doc-refs.sh --strict     # exit 1 when anything is DEAD
# Env: TEMPLATE_PATH
