## Significance

The app's actual screens. Every module here is **one user-facing capability** — its ViewModel, its
Compose screens, its navigation graph and its Koin module — and nothing else depends on it. That
one-way dependency is what makes a feature removable: `scripts/remove-demo.sh` strips the demo
features by deleting these directories and the aggregate regenerates without them.

**Why the modules look repetitive.** Each shipped feature is also the canonical demo of one framework
pattern — `loans` is the paging list plus draft-backed edit form, `cloudtodo` is the MUTABLE Store5
archetype with offline write-back, `macro` is the multi-source combine with independent per-card
state. `core/store/STORE_ARCHETYPES.yaml` names the pairing, and product-health fails the build when
an archetype loses its last showcase. Deleting a feature is therefore a deliberate act, not tidying.

**What a fork touches.** Add a directory, declare the feature's `store_archetype`, run codegen. The
registrations are DERIVED: `build-logic`'s `FeatureAggregateConventionPlugin` scans each module's
`di` and `navigation` packages and generates the Koin, destination and tab aggregates, so a new
feature needs no edit to `cmp-navigation`. Before that generator existed, adding a screen took an
import and a list entry in a registry, and forgetting either compiled cleanly while the feature
failed to resolve at runtime.
