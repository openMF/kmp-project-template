/**
 * Money tone — how a monetary amount should be colored regardless of the raw value's sign.
 *
 * Most call sites should use [MoneyTone.AutoFromSign] and pass the raw `amount` parameter;
 * [MoneyText] picks moneyPositive / moneyNegative / moneyNeutral from the finance palette
 * based on the sign.
 *
 * Use [MoneyTone.Positive] / [MoneyTone.Negative] / [MoneyTone.Neutral] to force a specific
 * tone (e.g. payment confirmation always green even though the user "paid" / amount is
 * conceptually negative).
 *
 * Use [MoneyTone.Inherit] when you want the surrounding `LocalContentColor` (e.g. inside a
 * gradient hero where black text would clash).
